# DECIDE › Simulate — Monte Carlo Simulation Analysis Report (Traceable • Customer-Centric • Replicable)

> **Reading guide**  
> • Every table uses explicit **units** and **frames**.  
> • Each cluster ends with a **WHY paragraph** — **Evidence → Inference → Implication** (what changes, who owns it, which KPI/criterion).  
> • No invented numbers: when inputs are missing, show **TBD** and log them in **Data Gaps & Collection Plan**.

---

## 0) Simulation Reference (Cross-Linked)
- **Criteria Lock:** `criteria-v1.0:abc123`  
- **Problem Source:** Define Agent (human resources turnover issue)  
- **Option Simulated:** Option A — Enhance retention programs to reduce turnover among specialized technicians  
- **Model Type:** Monte Carlo  
- **Iterations:** 10000  
- **Random Seed:** TBD  
- **Upstream Alignment:** implements thresholds from Criteria Lock (ROI / Turnover / Budget / SLA / Customer KPIs)

**WHY:** Show how upstream constraints and option scope shape which variables are simulated and which pass/fail thresholds are applied.

---

## 1) Variable Register (Distributions • Units • Frames • Sources)
> If upstream did **not** provide a value, use the declared safe default (and mark **Default Used**) — never silently assume.

| Variable | Distribution (type & params) | Mean / Location | Unit | Frame (cohort/geo/time) | Source (Doc-ID/§ or URL+date) | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| Cost per replacement | Triangular(25,000; 30,000; 40,000) | 30,000 | € / hire | Org-wide / FY | Default Used | From HR/Finance if present; else default |
| Turnover base | Normal(μ=22.4, σ=2.0) | 22.4 | % / headcount | Org / 12m | HR historical | Clamp to [0, 100] |
| Retention uplift | Uniform(2, 6) | 4.0 | pp | Pilot / 90d | Derived | From nudges/offer framing |
| Time-to-Impact | Triangular(4; 8; 12) | 8 | weeks | Pilot→Scale | PMO | First value realization |
| Budget limit | TBD | — | € | Project | Finance | Decision gate |
| SLA p95 | TBD | — | % @ p95 | Service / week | SRE/Ops | Criteria constraint |
| Customer KPI (e.g., NPS Δ) | TBD | — | points | Cohort/30–90d | CS/CX | Optional but recommended |
| ROI_12m | Derived | — | % | Org / 12m | Formula | Never a fixed input |

**Formulas (units & frames):**  
- `Savings_€ = Hires_avoided × Cost_per_replacement [€/hire]`  
- `Net_Benefit_€_12m = Savings_€ - Incremental_Costs_€`  
- `ROI_12m [%] = (Net_Benefit_€_12m / Investment_€) × 100`  
- Add any customer KPI transformations (e.g., completion ↑ → churn ↓ → LTV ↑).  

**WHY:** Evidence for distribution choices and frames; declare defaults & uncertainties that widen/shift outcome variance.

---

## 2) Model Structure & Criteria Constraints
- **Dependencies:** turnover ↓ → replacements ↓ → cost ↓ → ROI ↑; retention uplift → churn ↓ → LTV ↑.  
- **Correlations:** Assumed independent (justified).  
- **Criteria applied as gates (pass/fail per run):** e.g., ROI_12m ≥ 10%, Turnover ≤ 15%, Budget ≤ 1.5M €, SLA ≥ 99.5%, NPS Δ ≥ 5. 

**WHY:** Tie structure to goals; explain how each constraint trims the feasible set of outcomes.

---

## 3) Monte Carlo Configuration (Replicable)
- **Iterations:** 10000 (increase until mean ROI_12m stabilizes within **±1%**)  
- **Random Seed:** TBD  
- **Sampling Notes:** truncate/floor to valid domains (%, €); clamp tails if needed.  
- **Convergence Check:** mean ROI_12m pre/post last 2,000 runs within ±1%.

**WHY:** Replicability and stability justify trust in the reported percentiles and probabilities.

---

## 4) Results Summary (Primary KPIs — Units & Frames)
> Percentiles are **from the simulated distribution**, not fixed scenarios.

| KPI (unit) | Mean | P10 | P50 | P90 | Stdev |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ROI_12m (%) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Turnover (%) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Total Cost (€/12m) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Budget Overrun (€, if any) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| SLA p95 (%) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Customer KPI (e.g., NPS Δ, points) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

**WHY:** Interpret the central tendency vs. tail risk for decision criteria (who owns which KPI).

---

## 5) Goal Attainment vs. Criteria Lock (Probabilities)
| Criterion | Threshold (unit) | % of Runs Meeting | Evidence Hook |
|---|---|---:|---|
| ROI_12m ≥ 10% | 10% | TBD% | Distribution(ROI_12m) |
| Turnover ≤ 15% | 15% | TBD% | Distribution(Turnover) |
| Budget ≤ 1.5M € | 1.5M € | TBD% | Distribution(Cost) |
| SLA p95 ≥ 99.5% | 99.5% | TBD% | Distribution(SLA) |
| Customer KPI ≥ 5 | 5 | TBD% | Distribution(Customer KPI) |

**Highlight:**  
- ✅ Proportion passing all gates simultaneously: **TBD%**  
- ⚠️ Overrun risk **P(Cost > Budget)**: **TBD%**  

**WHY:** Links simulation to locked decision rules; clarifies pass rate and residual risks.

---

## 6) Sensitivity (Drivers of ROI) — Tornado & Correlations
> Rank by absolute **Spearman ρ** with ROI_12m; report unit deltas and ROI point impact.

| Variable | Δ used (unit) | Impact on ROI (points) | Spearman ρ | Rank |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| Turnover reduction | ±3 pp | TBD ROI pts | TBD | 1 |
| Cost per replacement | ±5,000 € | TBD ROI pts | TBD | 2 |
| Time-to-Impact | ±2 weeks | TBD ROI pts | TBD | 3 |
| Retention uplift | ±1 pp | TBD ROI pts | TBD | 4 |
| [Other] | [Δ] | TBD ROI pts | TBD | 5 |

**Elasticity Note (if meaningful):** e.g., +1 pp retention uplift → +0.9 ROI pts over 12m.  
**WHY:** Explicit levers for optimization; guides which assumptions/tests change the decision.

---

## 7) Behavioral Dynamics (Customer-Centric)
- **Salience/Visibility:** TBD → completion **+TBD pp** (90d).  
- **Defaults & Friction:** TBD → early retention **+TBD pp** (30–60d).  
- **Feedback Loops:** early success reduces 90d churn **TBD%**.  

| Lever | Param (dist) | Expected Effect (unit, timeframe) | Included in Sim? | Telemetry Hook |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Salience | Uniform(a,b) | +TBD pp completion / 30–90d | Yes/No | event_… |
| Defaults | Triangular(l,m,u) | +TBD pp retention / 30d | Yes/No | event_… |
| Friction↓ | Discrete {-1, -2 clicks} | +TBD pp conversion / 14d | Yes/No | event_… |

**WHY:** Connects human behavior mechanisms to measurable uplifts and ensures ethics/guardrails remain intact.

---

## 8) Scenario Cards (Percentile-Mapped)
> Scenarios are **derived** from the same distribution: **Optimistic = P90**, **Baseline = P50**, **Pessimistic = P10**.

| Metric | Optimistic (P90) | Baseline (P50) | Pessimistic (P10) | Range |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ROI_12m (%) | TBD | TBD | TBD | [P90–P10] |
| Turnover (%) | TBD | TBD | TBD | [..] |
| Cost (€/12m) | TBD | TBD | TBD | [..] |
| Time-to-Impact (weeks) | TBD | TBD | TBD | [..] |
| SLA p95 (%) | TBD | TBD | TBD | [..] |
| Customer KPI | TBD | TBD | TBD | [..] |

**WHY:** Shows what a good/typical/bad year looks like with the same assumptions.

---

## 9) Risk Metrics (Downside & Overrun)
- **VaR(5%) [€ / %]:** TBD — Maximum loss / downside at 95% confidence  
- **Expected Shortfall(5%) [€ / %]:** TBD — Average loss beyond VaR  
- **P(Cost > Budget):** TBD%  
- **P(Timeline > Plan):** TBD%  

**Top Quantified Risk Drivers:** TBD items with variance contribution.  
**WHY:** Indicates buffer/contingency sizing and where to place mitigations.

---

## 10) Visual Summaries (described; images optional)
- **Distribution (Histogram/Density):** ROI_12m, Cost, Turnover — show mean & P10/P50/P90 markers.  
- **CDF:** Probability of reaching ROI targets and staying under Budget.  
- **Tornado:** Ranked variable impact on ROI_12m.  
- **Scenario Boxplots:** Optimistic vs Baseline vs Pessimistic.

**WHY:** Make tails and trade-offs visually inspectable for decision speed.

---

## 11) Decision Guidance (Rules Aligned to Criteria)
- **GO** when **P(all gates pass) ≥ p_succ** (state p_succ, e.g., 70%) **and** VaR within tolerance.  
- **HOLD** if ROI meets but SLA/Customer KPIs fail with **P > 30%**.  
- **NO-GO** if **P(ROI_12m ≥ threshold) < 60%** or **P(Cost > Budget) > 30%** or catastrophic tail risk.  

**Early Triggers (post-launch):** If turnover reduction < TBD pp by week 6 or SLA p95 < TBD%, re-run simulation & re-decide.

**WHY:** Turns percentiles & probabilities into hard rules; transparent tie to Criteria Lock.

---

**WHY:** Shows how uncertainty will reduce over time; who is accountable.

## 13) Plain-English Explainer (For Executives & Customers)
**What Monte Carlo means in practice:** we “run the future” **10000** times to see typical, best, and worst outcomes.  
- **Most likely (P50):** TBD  
- **Best reasonable (P90):** TBD — chance ≈ 10% to do better  
- **Worst reasonable (P10):** TBD — ≈ 90% chance to do better  
- **Success odds:** *P(meet thresholds)* = **TBD%**  
- **Downside guardrails:** VaR/ES figures in €/%

**WHY:** Ensures non-technical stakeholders understand the decision and its risks.
