## What Do These Results Mean? - Simple Explanation for Decision Makers

### Understanding Monte Carlo Simulation in Plain English

Think of Monte Carlo simulation like this: **Imagine we could look into 1,000 different possible futures for your project and see what happens in each one.** Some futures are great, some are terrible, and most are somewhere in between. This simulation helps us understand:

- **What's most likely to happen?** (The average outcome)
- **What's the best we can reasonably hope for?** (The optimistic scenario)
- **What's the worst we should prepare for?** (The pessimistic scenario)
- **How risky is this decision?** (How much the outcomes vary)

### Breaking Down the Numbers - What They Really Mean

#### The Three Main Scenarios Explained

**🟢 Optimistic Scenario (90th Percentile)**
**What it means**: This is like the "best case scenario" - only 1 out of 10 times would things go better than this.

**In simple terms**: 
- Think of this as your "stretch goal" - it's achievable but requires things to go well
- This represents the outcome when most factors work in your favor
- You have a 10% chance of doing even better than this
- **Real-world analogy**: Like planning a road trip where you hit all green lights and have no traffic

**🟡 Baseline Scenario (50th Percentile - The Middle Ground)**
**What it means**: This is the "most likely" outcome - half the time you'll do better, half the time worse.

**In simple terms**:
- This is your "realistic expectation" - what you should probably plan for
- This represents normal conditions with typical challenges and successes
- It's like flipping a coin - 50/50 chance of doing better or worse than this
- **Real-world analogy**: Like your normal commute to work - some days better, some worse, but this is typical

**🔴 Pessimistic Scenario (10th Percentile - Worst Case Planning)**
**What it means**: This is the "what if things go wrong" scenario - only 1 out of 10 times would things be worse than this.

**In simple terms**:
- This is your "contingency planning" number - what to prepare for if problems arise
- You have a 90% chance of doing better than this outcome
- This helps you understand the downside risk you're accepting
- **Real-world analogy**: Like planning a road trip accounting for bad weather, traffic jams, and car trouble

#### Key Risk Indicators - What to Watch For

**📊 Standard Deviation (Volatility)**
- **What it measures**: How much the outcomes vary from the average
- **High number means**: More unpredictable, higher risk/reward
- **Low number means**: More predictable, lower risk/reward
- **Think of it like**: Weather forecast reliability - low volatility is like predicting tomorrow's weather, high volatility is like predicting weather 2 weeks out

**📉 Value at Risk (VaR)**
- **What it measures**: The maximum loss you might face in bad scenarios
- **How to read it**: "There's only a 5% chance we'll lose more than [VaR amount]"
- **Think of it like**: Insurance planning - this tells you the worst-case scenario to prepare for

**📈 Probability of Success**
- **What it measures**: The chance of meeting or exceeding your targets
- **How to interpret**: Higher percentage = better odds of success
- **Think of it like**: Weather forecast - 80% chance of success is like "80% chance of sunny weather"

### Making Decisions Based on These Results

#### If You're Risk-Averse (Conservative Approach)
- **Focus on**: The pessimistic scenario numbers
- **Ask yourself**: "Can we handle the worst-case outcome?"
- **Decision rule**: Only proceed if the pessimistic scenario is still acceptable
- **Strategy**: Build extra safety margins and contingency plans

#### If You're Risk-Neutral (Balanced Approach)
- **Focus on**: The baseline scenario numbers
- **Ask yourself**: "Is the most likely outcome worth the effort and investment?"
- **Decision rule**: Proceed if the baseline scenario meets your goals
- **Strategy**: Plan for the baseline but prepare for deviations

#### If You're Risk-Seeking (Aggressive Approach)
- **Focus on**: The optimistic scenario potential
- **Ask yourself**: "What's the upside potential if things go well?"
- **Decision rule**: Accept higher risk for higher potential rewards
- **Strategy**: Maximize upside while having contingency plans for downside

### Red Flags - When to Be Concerned

🚩 **High Volatility Warning**: If the difference between optimistic and pessimistic scenarios is huge, you're looking at a high-risk situation

🚩 **Negative Baseline**: If even the "most likely" scenario doesn't meet your minimum requirements, reconsider the project

🚩 **Low Success Probability**: If the chance of meeting your targets is less than 60-70%, you might need a better strategy

🚩 **Unacceptable Worst Case**: If the pessimistic scenario would be catastrophic for your organization, you need more safeguards

### Green Lights - Positive Indicators

✅ **Consistent Positive Outcomes**: All three scenarios (optimistic, baseline, pessimistic) are positive

✅ **High Success Probability**: 70%+ chance of meeting your key objectives

✅ **Manageable Downside**: Even the worst-case scenario is survivable and recoverable

✅ **Good Risk/Reward Ratio**: The potential upside justifies the downside risk

### Bottom Line Recommendations

**For Executive Summary**:
Based on running 1,000 different scenarios, here's what the numbers tell us:

1. **Most Likely Outcome**: €1,011,114.70 (the baseline scenario)
2. **Best Case Potential**: €1,265,315 (the optimistic scenario)
3. **Worst Case Planning**: €745,980 (the pessimistic scenario)
4. **Overall Risk Level**: Medium based on volatility
5. **Recommendation**: Proceed with the baseline scenario.

**The simulation essentially answers**: "If we ran this project 1,000 times, here's what would typically happen, what could go right, and what could go wrong - helping you make an informed decision about whether the potential rewards are worth the risks."
