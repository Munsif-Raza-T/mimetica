## 5) Sensitivity Table (Quick, Decision-Useful)
| Driver Variable | Δ | Δ ROI_12m | Δ Turnover Rate | Confidence | WHY (Mechanism) |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| Recruitment cost | +10% | −0.02 | +0.5 pp | 0.7 | Cost pressure undermines ROI & retention |
| Time-to-market | +2 weeks | −0.03 | −1.0 pp | 0.6 | Missed novelty window reduces uptake |
| Bonus spend | +5% | −0.01 | +0.2 pp | 0.8 | Incentives shift short-term churn |

**WHY:** isolate dominant sensitivities; identify thresholds that flip the recommendation.

---

## 6) Recommendation Rule (Operationalized)
- **Choose Option A if:** ROI_12m ≥ 10% **and** Payback ≤ 12 months **and** GDPR Pass; tie-break by **Primary Focus**.  
- **Choose Option B if:** Adoption_90d uplift ≥ 5 pp **and** Reliability_SLO ≥ 99.5% justifies longer TTI.  
- **Choose Option C if:** asymmetric upside or learning value dominates within risk budget.  
- **Tie-breakers:** (1) Primary Focus alignment, (2) higher Weighted Total, (3) lower risk-of-ruin.  
- **Early Triggers to Revisit:** variance thresholds on cost/adoption/schedule; compliance slip indicators.

**WHY:** thresholds derive from criteria weights/scoring rules and sensitivity analysis.

## 7) Consolidated Risk View (Cross-Option)
| ID | Risk | Option(s) | Prob (0–1) | Impact (€) | Horizon | Early Signal | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| RISK-1 | Inability to attract qualified candidates | A, B | 0.5 | 500K | 2025 | Low applicant flow | Broaden recruitment channels | HR Manager |
| RISK-2 | High competition for talent | A, B | 0.4 | 1M | 2025 | Increased offers from competitors | Competitive compensation review | HR Director |
| RISK-3 | Compliance with GDPR | A, B, C | 0.2 | 300K | 2025 | Audit finding | DPIA + DPA + Explainability pack | DPO |

**Interdependency Note:** e.g., Legal delay → Launch slip [days] → CAC ↑ [€/cust] → ROI ↓ [pp].  
**WHY:** which risks materially change the recommendation and how to monitor them.
