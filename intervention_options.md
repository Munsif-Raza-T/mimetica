## 3) Comparable Economics (Normalized)
> Show base, and if used, O/B/P bands or a 10k-run Monte Carlo summary (mean, p5, p50, p95).

**Normalization Rules:** FX rate (source/date), CPI base year (source), any scope reconciliation/PPP.

| Option | One-line Thesis | CapEx [€] | OpEx [€/period] | Net Benefit [€/period] | ROI_12m [%] | Payback [months] | NPV @WACC [€] | IRR [%] | CX/SLA Anchor (unit) | Assumption Notes | Provenance |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| A | Baseline Attraction and Retention Strategy | 1,500,000 | 0 | 300,000 | 20% | 8 | 1,200,000 | 20% | Turnover Rate (%) | Assumes turnover reduction to 15% | *(Source: Context §1.1)* |
| B | Ambitious Talent Acquisition and Retention Program | 2,500,000 | 0 | 600,000 | 24% | 6 | 1,800,000 | 24% | Turnover Rate (%) | Assumes turnover reduction to 12% | *(Source: Context §1.1)* |
| C | Partner with Educational Institutions | 1,500,000 | 0 | 250,000 | 17% | 10 | 900,000 | 17% | Number of Partnerships | Assumes establishment of 3 partnerships | *(Source: Context §1.1)* |

**Formulas used:**  
- `ROI = (Net Benefits / Investment) × 100`  
- `NPV = Σ_t (CF_t / (1+WACC)^t)` — state WACC inputs (rf, β, MRP)  
- `Payback = months until cum. net CF >= 0`  
(If elasticities used, state model/link.)

**WHY (3–5 bullets):** The differences in ROI and payback periods reflect the varying levels of investment and expected benefits from each option. Options B and C have higher initial costs but potentially greater long-term benefits, while Option A is more conservative but may limit growth potential.

## 5) Consolidated Risk View (Cross-Option)
> Summarize overlapping or cascading risks and their systemic effects.

| ID | Risk | Option(s) | Prob (0–1 or L-H) | Impact (€/unit or L-H) | Horizon | Early Signal | Mitigation (HOW) | Owner |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| RISK-1 | Inability to attract qualified candidates | A, B, C | 0.5 | High | 2025 | Limited applications | Broaden recruitment channels | HR Lead |
| RISK-2 | Non-compliance with GDPR | A, B, C | 0.2 | High | 2025 | Legal review failures | Conduct thorough compliance audits | Legal Team |
| RISK-3 | High competition for talent | A, B, C | 0.4 | Medium | 2025 | Increased salary offers | Adjust compensation packages | HR Lead |

## 6) Recommendation Rule (Operationalized)
- **Choose A if:** ROI_12m ≥ 15%, Payback ≤ 8 months.  
- **Choose B if:** ROI_12m ≥ 24%, Payback ≤ 6 months.  
- **Choose C if:** Establishment of 3 partnerships is feasible within the budget and timeline.  
- **Tie-breakers:** If options A and B are close, choose based on the lowest payback period.  
- **Early Triggers to Revisit:** If turnover rates exceed 20% or if budget overruns exceed 10%.

**WHY:** The recommendation rule connects observable thresholds to the criteria weights, ensuring that the chosen option aligns with strategic objectives and financial sustainability.
