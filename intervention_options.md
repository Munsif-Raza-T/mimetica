## 3) Comparable Economics (Normalized)
> Show base, and if used, O/B/P bands or a 10k-run Monte Carlo summary (mean, p5, p50, p95).

**Normalization Rules:** FX rate (source/date), CPI base year (source), any scope reconciliation/PPP.

| Option | One-line Thesis | CapEx [€] | OpEx [€/period] | Net Benefit [€/period] | ROI_12m [%] | Payback [months] | NPV @WACC [€] | IRR [%] | CX/SLA Anchor (unit) | Assumption Notes | Provenance |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| A | Baseline Recruitment and Retention Strategy | 1,500,000 | 200,000 | 1,000,000 | 66.67 | 12 | 500,000 | 20 | Turnover Rate (%) | Assumes effective strategies will attract applicants | Context §1.1, Feasibility §1 |
| B | Enhanced Training and Development Program | 2,000,000 | 300,000 | 1,200,000 | 60.00 | 15 | 600,000 | 18 | Employee Satisfaction Score (%) | Assumes training will improve retention | Context §1.1, Feasibility §1 |
| C | International Recruitment and Remote Work Strategy | 2,500,000 | 400,000 | 1,500,000 | 60.00 | 18 | 700,000 | 22 | Number of International Hires | Assumes international candidates will accept remote work | Context §1.1, Feasibility §1 |

**Formulas used:**  
- `ROI = (Net Benefits / Investment) × 100`  
- `NPV = Σ_t (CF_t / (1+WACC)^t)` — state WACC inputs (rf, β, MRP)  
- `Payback = months until cum. net CF >= 0`  
(If elasticities used, state model/link.)

**WHY (3–5 bullets):**  
- Option A has the highest ROI due to lower investment costs.  
- Option B has a moderate ROI but higher initial investment due to training costs.  
- Option C has a high NPV but requires significant investment and carries risks related to compliance and productivity.

## 4) Criteria-Fit (Three-Way)
> If Define locked criteria, use them; otherwise propose 6–10 and mark (Proposed).

| Criterion (unit) | Type (Outcome/Constraint/Capability) | Target/Threshold | Weight | A | B | C | One-line WHY | Source |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| ROI_12m (%) | Outcome | ≥ 15% | 1 | 66.67 | 60.00 | 60.00 | Higher ROI indicates better financial viability | Context §1.1 |
| Payback (months) | Outcome | ≤ 12 | 1 | 12 | 15 | 18 | Shorter payback periods are preferable for cash flow | Context §1.1 |
| Turnover Rate (%) | Outcome | < 15% | 1 | < 15 | < 12 | < 10 | Lower turnover rates are critical for project execution | Context §1.1 |
| Employee Satisfaction Score (%) | Outcome | ≥ 80% | 1 | TBD | 80 | TBD | Higher satisfaction correlates with lower turnover | Context §1.1 |

## 5) Consolidated Risk View (Cross-Option)
> Summarize overlapping or cascading risks and their systemic effects.

| ID | Risk | Option(s) | Prob (0–1 or L-H) | Impact (€/unit or L-H) | Horizon | Early Signal | Mitigation (HOW) | Owner |
|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| RISK-1 | High employee turnover continues | A, B, C | 0.6 | €1,000,000 | 2025 | Increased departures | Implement retention programs immediately | HR Lead |
| RISK-2 | Inability to attract qualified candidates | A, B, C | 0.5 | €750,000 | 2025 | Low applicant pool | Enhance recruitment marketing | HR Lead |
| RISK-3 | Regulatory compliance issues | A, B, C | 0.4 | €500,000 | 2025 | Compliance audits | Regular compliance checks | Legal Team |

**Interdependencies:**  
- High turnover → Increased recruitment costs → ROI ↓  
- Regulatory issues → Delays in hiring → Project timelines impacted  

**WHY:** These risks are critical as they can affect all options and lead to increased costs and project delays.

## 6) Recommendation Rule (Operationalized)
- **Choose A if:** ROI_12m ≥ 15% and Payback ≤ 12 months.  
- **Choose B if:** ROI_12m ≥ 15% but Payback > 12 months.  
- **Choose C if:** specific contrarian conditions are met, such as successful international recruitment.  
- **Tie-breakers:** If all options meet thresholds, choose based on lowest risk profile.  
- **Early Triggers to Revisit:** If turnover rates exceed 22% or if regulatory compliance issues arise.

**WHY:** The recommendation is based on observable thresholds that align with financial viability and risk management.
