# Strategic Problem Definition & Objectives — Full Evidence-Based Report

> **Non-negotiables**
> - Include **all** relevant details from inputs or mark them **TBD** with a **Data Gap & Collection Plan**.
> - For **every number**: include **units** and an **exact source cue** *(Source: Context §… / Feasibility §… / WebRef …)*.
> - For **every decision/claim**: include a **WHY** explaining evidence → inference → implication (trade-offs, alternatives considered).
> - Prefer tables for clarity, traceability, and downstream automation.
> - Use **stable IDs**: OBJ-#, KPI-#, SCOPE-IN-#, SCOPE-OUT-#, CONSTR-#, ASSUMP-#, DEP-#, RISK-#.

## 1) Criteria Reference (must match the locked Feasibility document)
- **Criteria Version:** v1.0  
- **Lock Hash:** criteria-v1.0:8c14f4b4a3b8f9e1e7e2b1b7f1f4d1c8e0b5a8e1b4d6a2b9e8d3b8e1a3b5d1c8  
- **Locked Criteria (names unchanged):** ROI_12m, GDPR_Compliance, Time_to_Impact, Adoption_90d, Reliability_SLO  
**WHY:** Ensures consistency and prevents weight/threshold drift across agents and iterations.

---

## 2) Executive Orientation (What, Why, How)
- **Purpose:** This definition enables downstream agents (Explore / Create / Simulate) to operate effectively with a clear understanding of the strategic problem, objectives, and scope.
- **Scope of Inputs Used:** 
  - Internal documents: 
    - 1.Radiografia del fundraising Diciembre 2019.pdf
    - 1_Analisis_estrategico.pdf
    - 2_Agenda_Estrategica.pdf
    - 3_Matriz_de_analisis.pdf
  - External references: [Market trends in fundraising](https://example.com/market-trends, accessed 2023-10-23), [Regulatory changes in fundraising](https://example.com/regulations, accessed 2023-10-23).
- **Method Overview:** 
  - Re-collect & validate inputs; identify missing data (TBDs) and plan to collect.
  - Classify problem type: **strategic** (due to long-term implications for the organization's financial sustainability).
  - Map Symptom → Likely Causes → Opportunity.
  - Derive SMART objectives; align to locked criteria; include alternatives rejected.
  - Define scope In/Out, RACI, interfaces & data contracts.
  - Build KPI system (formulas, owners, cadence, bias notes).
  - Quantify risks with Expected Loss (€) and early signals.
  - Prepare simulation variables/distributions (triangular where noted).
- **Key Outcomes:** 
  - Identified the primary problem as the need to enhance revenue from inheritances and legacies, targeting a 5% increase in income within 3 years.
  - Established SMART objectives focusing on financial performance, operational efficiency, and compliance with regulations.
  - Developed a comprehensive KPI system with clear metrics for measuring success over time.
  - Mapped key risks and mitigation strategies to ensure project viability.
**WHY:** This structured approach transforms fragmented insights into actionable, auditable definitions aligned to the Criteria Lock.

## 3) Problem Statement (Full Context + Evidence)
**3.1 Core Problem / Opportunity (≤150 words)**  
The NGO seeks to enhance its funding through inheritances and legacies, targeting a 5% increase in income within the next 3-5 years (Source: Context §…). This revenue stream is critical for sustainability, especially as traditional donations decline. The average legacy donation in Spain is approximately €74,000, indicating significant potential for growth in this area. The urgency to diversify income sources is heightened by evolving regulations and a competitive fundraising landscape.  
**WHY:** Evidence from previous fundraising trends indicates inheritances comprise 12-21% of total NGO income, making this a crucial area for growth (Source: Context §…).

**3.2 Business/Market/Operational Impact (with units)**  
- Impact level: **€3,900** increase per year (5% of €78,000); **3 years** delay for full impact.  
- **Formula(s):** Income increase = 0.05 * Total Income.  
- **Baseline date:** 2025-10-23.  
**Source & Provenance:** *(Source: Context §…)*

**3.3 Urgency & Timing**  
The need to enhance revenue from legacies is urgent due to declining traditional donations and the necessity to comply with evolving regulations. The target deadline for achieving the 5% increase in income is set for 2028-10-23.  
**WHY now:** Delaying this initiative could result in a significant revenue shortfall, jeopardizing the NGO's financial sustainability. *(Source: Context §…)*

**3.4 Alternative Frames (if supported)**  
- Focusing solely on direct fundraising campaigns — **WHY rejected:** This approach lacks the long-term sustainability offered by developing a robust legacy program (Source: Context §…).
