## 1) Problem Statement (Full Context + Evidence)
**1.1 Core Problem / Opportunity (≤150 words)**  
The core problem is a **22.4% turnover rate in specialized technicians** during 2024, which is projected to impact operational efficiency and financial performance over the next three years (2025–2027). High turnover leads to increased recruitment costs, operational disruptions, and knowledge loss, adversely affecting service delivery and customer satisfaction.  
- **Why:** This turnover rate results in significant costs associated with hiring and training new staff, as well as reduced productivity during the transition period.  
- **Source:** *(Source: Context §1)*

**1.2 Business Impact (with units)**  
Current impact level: **€1,000,000** projected loss over **2025-2027** due to turnover-related costs.  
- **Formula:** `Projected Loss = (Turnover Rate × Average Cost per Hire) × (Number of Technicians)`.  
- **Baseline date:** 2025-10-20.  
- **Source & Provenance:** *(Source: Feasibility §1)*

**1.3 Urgency & Timing**  
The urgency to address this issue arises from the need to stabilize workforce levels before the peak operational period in 2025 and to comply with financial performance expectations.  
- **Why now:** Immediate action is required to mitigate the long-term financial impact and enhance workforce stability.  
- **Source:** *(Source: Feasibility §1)*

**1.4 Alternative Frames (if supported by inputs)**  
- Alt-Frame-1: Focusing solely on recruitment strategies — **Why rejected:** Does not address retention issues, which are critical to long-term success, *(Source: Feasibility §1)*.  
- Alt-Frame-2: Implementing temporary staffing solutions — **Why rejected:** This may lead to further dissatisfaction among permanent staff and does not resolve the underlying turnover problem, *(Source: Feasibility §1)*.

## 2) Root-Cause & Driver Tree (Data-based)
**2.1 Driver Tree (Top → Leaf)**  
- **Core Problem: High Technician Turnover (22.4%)** *(Hypothesized)*
  - **Driver 1: Insufficient Career Development Opportunities** *(Validated)*
    - Signal: Employee feedback indicating lack of growth opportunities *(Source: D-001 §1)*
    - Evidence Strength: High — consistent feedback across multiple surveys.
    - Why It Matters: Lack of development leads to employee dissatisfaction and increased turnover.
  - **Driver 2: Inadequate Compensation** *(Validated)*
    - Signal: Market wage comparisons show below-average salaries *(Source: D-001 §1)*
    - Evidence Strength: High — industry benchmarks indicate wage disparities.
    - Why It Matters: Competitive compensation is critical for retention.
  - **Driver 3: Poor Work-Life Balance** *(Hypothesized)*
    - Signal: Employee exit interviews cite long hours and stress *(Source: D-001 §1)*
    - Evidence Strength: Medium — anecdotal but consistent themes.
    - Why It Matters: Work-life balance impacts employee satisfaction and retention.

**2.2 Primary Causes (3–6) — Evidence Packs**  
For each cause:
- **Insufficient Career Development Opportunities**  
  - Description: Limited training and advancement pathways available for technicians.  
  - **Quant signal:** 40% of employees expressed dissatisfaction with career growth *(Source: D-001 §1)*.  
  - **Qual signal:** “I feel stuck in my current role” *(Source: D-001 §1)*.  
  - **Counter-evidence:** Some employees report satisfaction with existing training programs; resolution requires more targeted development initiatives.  
  - **Why we believe it:** High turnover in organizations with limited growth pathways is well-documented.

- **Inadequate Compensation**  
  - Description: Salary levels are below market averages, leading to dissatisfaction.  
  - **Quant signal:** Average salary is €5,000 below industry standard *(Source: D-001 §1)*.  
  - **Qual signal:** Employee feedback indicates feeling undervalued *(Source: D-001 §1)*.  
  - **Counter-evidence:** Some employees value non-monetary benefits; however, this does not offset salary dissatisfaction.  
  - **Why we believe it:** Competitive compensation is a well-known factor in employee retention.

**2.3 External/Systemic Factors**  
- **Market Demand for Skilled Technicians**: Increasing industry demand for specialized technicians is heightening competition for talent, impacting retention efforts *(Source: D-001 §1)*.  
- **Regulatory Changes**: New compliance requirements may affect workload and job satisfaction *(Source: D-001 §1)*.

## 3) Strategic Objectives (SMART + Why + Alternatives)
### OBJ-1 — Attraction Strategies
- **Specific:** Identify ≥3 viable attraction strategies for specialized technicians — **Why this scope:** Directly addresses the need to improve hiring practices to counteract turnover, linking to the driver of inadequate recruitment efforts *(Source: D-001 §1)*.
- **Measurable:** Metric: Number of strategies identified; **Formula:** `Count of Attraction Strategies`; **Data Source:** HR Reports; **Owner:** HR Team.
- **Achievable:** Based on previous successful recruitment campaigns, resources are available for implementation *(Source: D-001 §1)*.
- **Relevant:** Aligns with the core problem of turnover and the identified driver of inadequate recruitment strategies.
- **Time-bound:** Deadline: 2025-12-31.
- **Baseline:** TBD.
- **Target:** Identify 3 strategies by 2025-12-31.  
  - **Why this target:** Three strategies are feasible based on prior recruitment efforts and market analysis *(Source: D-001 §1)*.
  - **Alternatives considered:** Two strategies — **Why rejected:** Without a minimum of three, the risk of insufficient coverage remains high.

### OBJ-2 — Turnover Reduction
- **Specific:** Achieve turnover ≤15% — **Why this scope:** This directly targets the core problem of high turnover rates and aligns with the operational need for stability *(Source: D-001 §1)*.
- **Measurable:** Metric: Turnover Rate; **Formula:** `Total Departures / Average Headcount × 100`; **Data Source:** HR Reports; **Owner:** HR Team.
- **Achievable:** Current turnover is 22.4%; a targeted reduction is feasible with proposed interventions.
- **Relevant:** Directly links to the problem of high turnover and aims to stabilize operations.
- **Time-bound:** Deadline: 2025-12-31; interim target: ≤18% by 2025-06-30 if necessary.
- **Baseline:** 22.4% turnover as of 2024-12-31 *(Source: D-001 §1)*.
- **Target:** Achieve ≤15% turnover by 2025-12-31, with an interim target of ≤18% by 2025-06-30.  
  - **Why this target:** This represents a significant improvement that is achievable based on market strategies and compensation adjustments *(Source: D-001 §1)*.
  - **Alternatives considered:** A target of ≤12% — **Why rejected:** This may not be realistic given current market conditions and could lead to burnout among HR teams.

### OBJ-3 — ROI Improvement
- **Specific:** Achieve **ROI_12m ≥10%** — **Why this scope:** This provides a clear financial benchmark for assessing the success of turnover reduction initiatives *(Source: D-001 §1)*.
- **Measurable:** Metric: ROI; **Formula:** `Net Benefits / Total Investment × 100`; **Data Source:** Financial Reports; **Owner:** Finance Team.
- **Achievable:** Previous initiatives have yielded ROI upwards of 8%, indicating potential for improvement.
- **Relevant:** Directly relates to financial performance linked to reduced turnover.
- **Time-bound:** Deadline: 2025-12-31.
- **Baseline:** TBD.
- **Target:** Achieve ROI ≥10% by 2025-12-31.  
  - **Why this target:** This is a minimal acceptable return given the investment in retention strategies *(Source: D-001 §1)*.
  - **Alternatives considered:** ROI ≥12% — **Why rejected:** Higher targets could require disproportionate investment with diminishing returns.
