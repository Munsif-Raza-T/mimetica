## 2) Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) & Acceptance (RELATIVE TIME)
**Minimums:** **4 Phases** (Preparation → Core Implementation → Integration & Testing → Deployment), **≥4 Workstreams**, **10–16 Work Packages (WPs)**.

| Phase                 | Workstream        | WP ID | Work Package                          | Deliverables                        | Objective Acceptance Criteria                           | Dependencies                  | Effort [FTE-weeks] | Duration [weeks] | % Slack | Provenance         |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------|
| Preparation           | Training Design    | WP-1  | Develop training curriculum            | Training materials                  | Curriculum approved by HR Director                      | None                           | 2                  | 2                | 5%      | Create §2.B         |
| Core Implementation    | Training Delivery  | WP-2  | Launch skills training                 | Training sessions completed         | 80% participation from technicians                       | WP-1                          | 3                  | 4                | 5%      | Create §2.B         |

## 3) Behavioral Economics Plan (Choice Architecture & Nudges)
**Minimums:** **8–12** interventions across the journey including at least: **1 default**, **1 framing**, **1 social proof**, **1 friction reduction**, **1 timing/reminder**, **1 commitment device**, **1 loss aversion/sunk-cost guard**, **1 salience/visual hierarchy**.

| ID | Journey Step        | Decision to Influence         | Mechanism (bias/heuristic) | Intervention (what/how/where)                | Microcopy/Label               | Variants (A/B/…) | Expected Effect [unit, timeframe] | Guardrails & Ethics              | Telemetry Event(s)     | Owner    | Provenance         |
|----|---------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|----------|---------------------|
| N1 | Training Enrollment  | Participation                 | Commitment                | Default opt-in for training sessions        | "Join the training to improve!"| A/B test on phrasing | +5% participation in sign-ups [1 week] | Clear opt-out option             | Training signed-up event | HR Lead  | Create §2.B         |
| N2 | Survey Completion    | Feedback                      | Social Proof              | Show peer completion rates on surveys      | "Most peers completed this!"  | A/B test on visibility | +10% survey completion [1 week]  | Transparency on data usage       | Survey completed event  | HR Lead  | Create §2.B         |
| N3 | Mentorship Program   | Engagement                   | Salience                  | Highlight benefits of mentorship            | "Get matched with a mentor!"  | Variants | +15% mentorship engagement [2 weeks] | Ethical matching policies         | Mentorship matched event | HR Lead  | Create §2.B         |
| N4 | Training Completion   | Retention                    | Friction Reduction        | Simplified feedback forms post-training    | "Your feedback is valuable!"   | A/B test on form length | +20% feedback provided [1 week]  | Minimal required inputs          | Feedback submitted event | HR Lead  | Create §2.B         |
| N5 | Attendance Reminder  | Participation                 | Timing                    | Automated reminders for training sessions   | "Don't forget your training!"  | Variants | +10% attendance [1 week]         | Reminder frequency limit          | Reminder sent event     | HR Lead  | Create §2.B         |

**Measurement Rules:** primary metric per nudge (unit, frame), **guardrails** (min/max effect; fairness), **exposure control**.  
**Ethics:** no dark patterns; truthful scarcity; easy opt-out; consent where relevant.

**WHY:** Carefully chosen levers reduce friction & improve adoption with measurable, ethical effects.

## 4) Architecture, NFRs & Environments
- **High-Level Architecture:** 
  - Components include LMS for training delivery, survey platforms for feedback collection, and HR systems for tracking turnover.
  - Data flows from training sessions to feedback surveys, with external dependencies on survey tools.
- **NFRs (targets):** 
  - Availability 99.9%, p95 latency ≤ 100 ms, throughput 100 req/s, error budget ≤ 1/hr, RPO/RTO ≤ 15 min.
- **Environments:** 
  - Development and testing environments with parity for training material; staging for mentorship tools.
- **Security & Privacy:** 
  - Authn/authz via role-based access; encryption for sensitive data; DPIA required with a lead time of 30 days.
- **Observability:** 
  - Implement logs for training participation, survey completion, and engagement metrics; dashboards for real-time monitoring.

**SLO/SLA Table (REQUIRED)**

| Service/Flow      | SLI                                | SLO Target                | Error Budget (per period) | Alert Threshold         | Pager Policy                   | Owner    | Runbook               |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|----------|----------------------|
| Training System    | Training completion rate            | ≥80% completion           | ≤5% of sessions missed    | >5% of sessions missed  | Alert HR Lead                  | HR Lead  | HR training runbook   |
| Feedback System    | Survey response rate                | ≥80% response rate        | ≤5% of surveys not completed| >5% not completed      | Alert HR Lead                  | HR Lead  | HR survey runbook     |

**WHY:** NFR/SLO alignment prevents value erosion and service instability post-launch.

## 5) Data, Telemetry & Measurement Spec
**Map every KPI/criterion and nudge to events/metrics with schema & cadence.**

| Signal               | Type (event/metric) | Schema (fields & types)                     | Unit  | Frame (cohort/geo/time) | Source System | Cadence  | DQ Checks                       | Retention | Consumers         | Provenance         |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------|----------------|----------|----------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Turnover Rate        | Metric              | { "technicians_leaving": "int", "total_techs": "int" } | %     | Monthly                 | HR Reports     | Monthly  | Cross-validate with HR records  | 12 months | HR Team           | Create §2.B         |
| Training Completion   | Event               | { "session_id": "string", "completed": "boolean", "technician_id": "string" } | boolean | Weekly                  | LMS            | Weekly   | Compare against attendance logs   | 6 months  | HR Team           | Create §2.B         |
| Engagement Score      | Metric              | { "survey_id": "string", "average_score": "float" } | score | Quarterly               | Survey Tool    | Quarterly| Validate with HR feedback        | 12 months | HR Team           | Create §2.B         |

**Formulas:**  
- `ROI = (Net Benefits / Investment) × 100`  
- `NPV = Σ_t (CF_t / (1+WACC)^t)`  
- `Payback = months until cum. net CF ≥ 0`  
- `LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin × 1/Churn`  

**Normalization:** **FX** [rate, date, source], **CPI** [base year, source], **PPP** (if used).  
**WHY:** Ensures comparable, auditable measurement across phases and cohorts.

**Intermediate Milestones (MANDATORY):** 
- Retention +2 pp at Week 6
- Offer-accept +5 pp at Week 4

**Critical Path & Slack**

| Task                  | Depends On | Slack [days] | Risk if Slips | Mitigation                  | Owner    |
|-----------------------|------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------------------|----------|
| WP-1                  | None       | 0             | Delay in curriculum approval  | Early engagement with HR Director | HR Lead  |
| WP-2                  | WP-1      | 0             | Delay in training sessions    | Set up pilot training first   | HR Lead  |

**WHY:** Sequencing maximizes early value, protects critical dependencies, and keeps slack under control.

**WHY:** Focuses leaders on the few constraints that govern Go/No-Go and safe rollout.

---

## 12) Rollout, Cut-over & Reversibility
- **Rollout:** Pilot training session with a small group of technicians; gradual traffic ramps to full cohort participation; clear eligibility criteria for participation.
- **Feature Flags:** Ownership by HR Lead; flip protocol established for new training materials; audit trail for changes.
- **Cut-over Runbook:** Step-by-step timeline for launching training sessions, roles assigned for each step, go/no-go criteria established based on attendance rates.
- **Rollback Playbooks:** Triggers for rollback include failure to meet attendance thresholds; steps outlined for data reconciliation and stakeholder notifications.

**WHY:** Reversibility and staged exposure protect users and the business while learning.

---

## 13) Post-Launch Monitoring & Adaptive Control
- **Dashboards:** KPIs tracked include turnover rates, training completion rates, engagement scores; alert thresholds established for each KPI.
- **Ops:** MTTA/MTTR targets set for incident response; incident management process documented.
- **Learning Loop:** Weekly review of engagement data; decision log maintained to track performance and necessary adjustments.
- **Benefits Tracking:** Baseline turnover rates compared to actual rates post-implementation; ROI realization calendar established.

**WHY:** Ensures value realization and continuous risk control.
