## 1) Executive Summary (≤1 page; REQUIRED)
> **Minimum fill:** 3 quantified bullets with units/timeframes + 1 clear verdict.

- **Objective & Context (1–2 lines):** The objective is to assess the feasibility of a new product launch based on quality, risk, compliance, market demand, and adoption metrics.
- **Top 3 quantified drivers:**  
  1) Document Quality Score: 93% — D-001 §1 (2025-10-20)  
  2) Risk Probability: 0.2 — D-001 §1 (2025-10-20)  
  3) Compliance Score: 85% — D-001 §1 (2025-10-20)  
- **Verdict:** **Go** with measurable conditions (thresholds: Quality Score ≥ 70%, Risk Probability ≤ 0.25 by 2025-11-20).  
- **Decision timeline:** 0–14 days (owners: Quality Team, Risk Management; effort: 40 hours; budget: €5,000).
