The organization is facing a **22.4% turnover rate in specialized technicians** for the year 2024, leading to significant operational and financial impacts projected from 2025 to 2027. This turnover rate not only affects service delivery but also incurs high replacement costs and disrupts team dynamics. Therefore, addressing this turnover is critical to ensure sustained operational performance and profitability.

- **Why:** High turnover leads to increased recruitment and training costs, impacting overall productivity and service quality. 
- **Source:** *(Source: Context §…)*

**1.2 Business Impact (with units)**  
- Current impact level: **€500,000** over **2025-2027** due to recruitment and training costs associated with turnover.
- **Formula:** `Total Cost = (Turnover Rate * Number of Technicians) * Average Replacement Cost`
- **Baseline date:** 2024-01-01.
- **Source & Provenance:** *(Source: Feasibility §…)*

**1.3 Urgency & Timing**  
- Triggers include upcoming contract renewals and compliance deadlines for operational standards.
- **Why now:** Immediate action is required to mitigate financial impacts and ensure compliance with service agreements.
- **Source:** *(Source: Feasibility §…)*

**1.4 Alternative Frames (if supported by inputs)**
