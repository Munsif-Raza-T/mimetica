- **Project Name**: Human Resources Operational/Decision-Making Problem (2025): Attraction and Retention Strategy for Specialized Technicians  
- **Project Description**: The company experienced a 7.5% workforce growth in 2024, reaching 284 employees, but also suffered a 22.4% turnover rate among specialized technicians in renewables and electric mobility. This jeopardizes project execution between 2025–2027. The challenge is to determine the most profitable attraction and retention strategy for specialized technicians in 2025, balancing new talent incorporation and turnover reduction, without exceeding a 10% increase in total labor costs.
- **Analysis Focus**: Simulate the profitability, costs, and risks of each scenario. Evaluate their impact on turnover rates, technician availability, and financial sustainability. Identify which scenario (or combination of measures) yields the highest probability of positive return in 2025 while enhancing medium-term talent sustainability.
