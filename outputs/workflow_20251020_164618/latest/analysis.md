# Adaptive Multidisciplinary Feasibility & Criteria — Locked, Auditable Report

> **Non-negotiables**
> • Every claim includes a **WHY** (evidence → inference → implication).  
> • Every metric has a **unit** and a **time frame** (cohort/geo/period).  
> • **Provenance** (Doc-ID/§ or URL + access date) accompanies all material facts.  
> • Minimum content rules are enforced (counts shown in each section).  
> • Tables use stable IDs (CRIT-#, TECH-#, LEG-#, FIN-#, MKT-#, ORG-#, COMMS-#, BEH-#, RISK-#).
