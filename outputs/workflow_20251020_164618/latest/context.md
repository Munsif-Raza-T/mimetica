## Project
- **Name:** Human Resources Operational/Decision-Making Problem (2025): Attraction and Retention Strategy for Specialized Technicians
- **Description:** The company experienced a 7.5% workforce growth in 2024, reaching 284 employees, but also suffered a 22.4% turnover rate among specialized technicians in renewables and electric mobility. This jeopardizes project execution between 2025–2027.
The challenge is to determine the most profitable attraction and retention strategy for specialized technicians in 2025, balancing new talent incorporation and turnover reduction, without exceeding a 10% increase in total labor costs.
Operational objectives include:
1.	Identifying 2–3 viable strategies for attraction and retention (e.g., international recruitment, internal training school, loyalty programs).
2.	Comparing scenarios by profitability, cost, and impact on productivity and turnover.
3.	Selecting the optimal scenario that ensures a positive return in 2025 within the +10% labor cost limit.
Constraints include a maximum €1.5M budget for 2025 HR policies, a scarcity of young domestic talent, strong competition from multinational firms, and limited internal training capacity.
Three preliminary scenarios to evaluate:
•	Scenario A: International recruitment (Portugal and Latin America) — fast onboarding, higher cost.
•	Scenario B: Internal school for installers with educational partnerships — slower impact, lower cost.
•	Scenario C: Loyalty bonuses and flexible work policies — stronger retention, weaker attraction.
- **Analysis Focus:** •	Simulate the profitability, costs, and risks of each scenario. •	Evaluate their impact on turnover rates, technician availability, and financial sustainability. •	Identify which scenario (or combination of measures) yields the highest probability of positive return in 2025 while enhancing medium-term talent sustainability.
