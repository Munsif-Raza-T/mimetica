- **Source:** *(Source: Context §1)*

**1.2 Business Impact (with units)**  
Current impact level: **€1.5M** over **2025–2027** due to turnover.  
- **Formula:** `Impact = Turnover Rate × Average Cost per Turnover`  
- **Baseline date:** 2024-12-31.  
- **Source & Provenance:** *(Source: Context §1)*

**1.3 Urgency & Timing**  
Triggers include the need for compliance with labor regulations and the upcoming project deadlines in **Q1 2025**. Addressing turnover is essential to maintain competitive advantage and operational readiness.  
- **Why now:** The urgency arises from the impending project execution phases that require a stable workforce.  
- **Source:** *(Source: Context §1)*

**1.4 Alternative Frames (if supported by inputs)**  
- Alt-Frame-1: Focusing solely on recruitment strategies — **Why rejected:** This ignores the retention aspect, which is critical to reducing turnover. *(Source: Context §1)*  
- Alt-Frame-2: Implementing blanket salary increases — **Why rejected:** This may not address underlying engagement issues and could exceed budget constraints. *(Source: Context §1)*

## 2) Root-Cause & Driver Tree (Data-based)
**2.1 Driver Tree (Top → Leaf)**  
- **High Turnover Rate (Validated)**  
  - **Insufficient Training Opportunities (Validated)**  
    - Signal: 45% of technicians report inadequate training *(Source: Context §7)*  
    - Evidence Strength: High  
    - Why It Matters: Training impacts job satisfaction and retention. 
  - **Poor Employee Engagement (Hypothesized)**  
    - Signal: Low engagement scores (average 55/100) *(Source: Context §7)*
