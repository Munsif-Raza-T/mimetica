# Adaptive Multidisciplinary Feasibility & Criteria — Locked, Auditable Report

**Non-negotiables**
- Every claim includes a **WHY** (evidence → inference → implication).
- Every metric has a **unit** and a **time frame** (cohort/geo/period).
- **Provenance** (Doc-ID/§ or URL + access date) accompanies all material facts.
- Minimum content rules are enforced (counts shown in each section).
- Tables use stable IDs (CRIT-#, TECH-#, LEG-#, FIN-#, MKT-#, ORG-#, COMMS-#, BEH-#, RISK-#).

## 0) Criteria — Version & Lock (Adaptive; 4–7 criteria REQUIRED)
**Criteria Version:** v1.0  
**Locked At:** 2025-10-20 13:54:23  
**Lock Hash (SHA256 of criteria text):** criteria-v1.0:<short-hash>  
*(Cite this hash in ALL downstream agents.)*

> **Requirement:** 4–7 context-derived criteria (domain-agnostic). Weights must sum to **1.00**. Each criterion must define metric, unit, cadence, owner, thresholds, normalization rule, and a one-line WHY.
