## 1) Problem Statement (Full Context + Evidence)
**1.1 Core Problem / Opportunity (≤150 words)**  
The company faces a **22.4% turnover rate** among specialized technicians in renewables and electric mobility, which jeopardizes project execution from 2025 to 2027. This high turnover is driven by a **scarcity of domestic talent**, strong competition from multinationals, and limited internal training capacity. Addressing this challenge through effective attraction and retention strategies presents an opportunity to stabilize the workforce and enhance project execution.  
- **Why:** High turnover directly impacts project timelines and costs, necessitating a strategic response to improve retention and attract new talent.  
- **Source:** *(Source: Feasibility §1.1)*

**1.2 Business Impact (with units)**  
Current impact level: **22.4% turnover rate** in 2024 among specialized technicians.  
- **Formula:** `Turnover Cost = (Number of Departures × Average Cost per Departure)`  
- **Baseline date:** 2024-12-31.  
- **Source & Provenance:** *(Source: Feasibility §1.1)*

**1.3 Urgency & Timing**  
Immediate actions are required to mitigate turnover risks and align with project timelines. The implementation deadline for initial strategies is **2025-01-31**.  
- **Why now:** Timely execution is critical to ensure project demands are met and to stabilize workforce availability.  
- **Source:** *(Source: Context §2)*

**1.4 Alternative Frames (if supported by inputs)**  
- Alt-Frame-1: Focusing solely on recruitment strategies — **Why rejected:** This does not address retention, which is a significant issue driving turnover, *(Source: Context §2)*.  
- Alt-Frame-2: Concentrating exclusively on training programs — **Why rejected:** Limited internal capacity makes it impractical without complementary attraction strategies, *(Source: Feasibility §1.1)*.
