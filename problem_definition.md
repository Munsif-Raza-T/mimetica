# Strategic Problem Definition and Objectives

## Problem Statement
### Core Problem Description
- **Primary Problem**: The current strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing campaign ROI are not delivering the expected financial returns and overall effectiveness.
- **Problem Context**: Given the rapid changes in market dynamics and increasing competition, the current initiatives lack the required technology and stakeholder engagement to ensure success.
- **Business Impact**: The current ROI is falling short of projections by approximately 20%, resulting in significant lost revenue opportunities estimated at $500,000 annually.
